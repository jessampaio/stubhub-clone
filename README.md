The goal of this project is to build a website that functions similarly to StubHub. I'm currently working on the ability for the admin to create an event.
Database was designed in SQL, front-end is React and the project is running on a Node server. I'm using Typescript both on the front-end and back-end.
I'm planning to have the back-end partially in Python once I get the main functionalities working. Eventually, I will deploy it on AWS.
