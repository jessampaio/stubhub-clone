The goal of this project is to build a website that functions similarly to StubHub.
Database was designed in SQL, front-end is React and the project is running on a Node/Express server. I'm using Typescript both on the front-end and back-end.
I'm planning to have some of my routes in Python/Django once I get the main functionalities working. Eventually, I will deploy it on AWS.
