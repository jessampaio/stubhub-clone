I'm trying to build a website that functions similarly to StubHub. This is my first solo project.
I designed the database in SQL, front-end is React and the project is running on a Node/Express server. 
I'm using Typescript both on the front-end and back-end.
I'm planning to have some of my routes in Python/Django and Go once I get the main functionalities working. 
Eventually, I will deploy it on AWS! :P
